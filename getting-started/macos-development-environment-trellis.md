Trellis relies on a few additional software packages to function. Install these packages:

- VirtualBox >= 4.3.10
- Vagrant >= 2.1.0
- Ansible >= 2.5.3

## VirtualBox

Download and install the "OS X Hosts" version of VirtualBox from [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## Vagrant

Install Vagrant from Homebrew:

```sh
$ brew cask install vagrant
```

## Ansible

If you don't already have pip (Python package manager) installed, install it:

```sh
$ sudo easy_install pip
```

Install Ansible with pip:

```sh
$ pip install ansible
```

To install a specific Ansible version:

```sh
$ pip install ansible==2.7.5
```
