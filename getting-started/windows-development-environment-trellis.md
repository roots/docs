Trellis relies on a few other software tools. Install these tools:

- VirtualBox >= 4.3.10 (install on Windows)
- Vagrant >= 1.8.5 (install on Windows)
- Ansible >= 2.4 (install in WSL)


## VirtualBox

Download and install the latest version of [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for Windows.

## Vagrant

[Download the latest version of Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) for Windows.

Then alias `vagrant` in WSL to `vagrant.exe`:

**⚠️ The following commands must be run from WSL ([Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)).**

```sh
$ echo 'alias vagrant=vagrant.exe' >> ~/.zshrc
$ source ~/.zshrc
```

## Ansible

**⚠️ The following commands must be run from WSL ([Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)).**

Install pip (Python package manager) if you don't already have it:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
```

Install Ansible with pip:
```sh
$ pip install ansible

# Install a specific Ansible version:
$ pip install ansible==2.4.0.0
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Maximum recursion depth exceeded

If you run into a "maximum recursion depth exceeded" error while provisioning, try downgrading Ansible to 2.5.1 (`pip install ansible==2.5.1`) and then re-provisioning.

You'll also need to update your [`vagrant.default.yml`](https://github.com/roots/trellis/blob/19b0ce6da683d7038484e55b6a312776057a04a6/vagrant.default.yml#L7) so that `vagrant_ansible_version` references 2.5.1:

```diff
-vagrant_ansible_version: '2.7.5'
+vagrant_ansible_version: '2.5.1'
```

#### `vagrant ssh` doesn't work

Try:

```sh
$ echo 'alias vssh="ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no vagrant@127.0.0.1 -i ./.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key -p"' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Slow site

If your site loads extremely slowly, try installing the `vagrant-winnfsd` plugin. In some cases this plugin can cause problems, so you may need to uninstall it if things get worse.

**⚠️ The following commands must be run from WSL ([Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)).**

```sh
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-winnfsd
$ vagrant reload # if Vagrant was already running
```

If `vagrant-winnfsd` causes problems, before uninstalling it you can try forcing it to mount using TCP instead of UDP by adding `nfs_udp: false` to the NFS mount point configuration lines in your `Vagrantfile`.
