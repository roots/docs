Sage relies on a few build tools to manage dependencies and build assets. Install these tools:

- nvm
- Node.js < 10.0
- yarn

## nvm

Install nvm from the instructions at [https://github.com/creationix/nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), or with the following command:

```sh
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
```

## Node.js

Install Node.js < 10.0 from nvm:

```sh
$ nvm install lts/carbon
```

## yarn

Install yarn:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install yarn
```
