Trellis, Bedrock, and Sage development on Ubuntu Linux is supported by several libraries and software packages. This guide describes how to get the following packages installed and configured on your computer:

- Git
- Composer

## Git

Git is available from the standard Ubuntu software repositories and may be installed with the following command:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

Configure Git with your user information:

```sh
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "yourname@example.com"
```

## Composer

Install Composer from the standard Ubuntu software repositories:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install composer
```

## SSH Keys

### Create SSH Keys

Trellis and GitHub both use SSH keys to communicate securely without the need to type a username and password each time. Create your SSH keys:

```sh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

For more details on generating SSH keys, see [GitHub's excellent documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/).

### Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent

Modify your `~/.ssh/config` file to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain.

Edit your `~/.ssh/config` file and add the following lines:

```sh
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
