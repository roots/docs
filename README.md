# Docs

This repository is synced with the Roots docs for our primary projects:

* [Sage Docs](https://roots.io/sage/docs/)
* [Bedrock Docs](https://roots.io/bedrock/docs/)
* [Trellis Docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/)

The syncing is handled by the [WordPress GitHub Sync](https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-github-sync) plugin. Right now it's not possible to import new docs from GitHub into WordPress. If a new page needs to be added, it must first be added via the WordPress admin. 

Please use the [Roots Discourse](https://discourse.roots.io/) to open a discussion about bigger changes before sending a pull request.
