[Composer](http://getcomposer.org) is used to manage dependencies. Bedrock considers any 3rd party library as a dependency including WordPress itself and any plugins.

See these two blogs for more extensive documentation:

* [Using Composer with WordPress](https://roots.io/using-composer-with-wordpress/)
* [WordPress Plugins with Composer](https://roots.io/wordpress-plugins-with-composer/)

## Plugins

[WordPress Packagist](http://wpackagist.org/) is already registered in the `composer.json` file so any plugins from the [WordPress Plugin Directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/) can easily be required.

To add a plugin, add it under the `require` directive or use `composer require <namespace>/<packagename>` from the command line. If it's from WordPress Packagist then the namespace is always `wpackagist-plugin`.

Example: `"wpackagist-plugin/akismet": "dev-trunk"`

Whenever you add a new plugin or update the WP version, run `composer update` to install your new packages.

`plugins`, and `mu-plugins` are Git ignored by default since Composer manages them. If you want to add something to those folders that *isn't* managed by Composer, you need to update `.gitignore` to whitelist them:

`!web/app/plugins/plugin-name`

Note: Some plugins may create files or folders outside of their given scope, or even make modifications to `wp-config.php` and other files in the `app` directory. These files should be added to your `.gitignore` file as they are managed by the plugins themselves, which are managed via Composer. Any modifications to `wp-config.php` that are needed should be moved into `config/application.php`.

## Updating WP and plugin versions

Updating your WordPress version (or any plugin) is just a matter of changing the version number in the `composer.json` file.

Then running `composer update` will pull down the new version.

### Automating updates

[Dependencies.io](https://www.dependencies.io/) is an automated dependency update service that can be used to update WordPress and WordPress plugins. Signup for the service and add a `dependencies.yml` file to your project root:

```yaml
# dependencies.yml
# See https://www.dependencies.io/docs/
version: 2
dependencies:
- type: php
  path: / # /site for a Bedrock & Trellis site
  manifest_updates:
    filters:
    - name: "roots/wordpress"
      versions: "Y.Y.Y"
    - name: ".*"
      versions: "L.Y"
```

See the [Automate WordPress and Plugin Updates with Composer](https://roots.io/automate-wordpress-and-plugin-updates-with-composer/) post for more details.

## Themes

Themes can also be managed by Composer but should only be done so under two conditions:

1. You're using a parent theme that won't be modified at all
2. You want to separate out your main theme and use that as a standalone package

Under most circumstances, we recommend NOT doing #2 and instead keeping your main theme as part of your app's repository.

Just like plugins, WPackagist maintains a Composer mirror of the WP theme directory. To require a theme, just use the `wpackagist-theme` namespace.
