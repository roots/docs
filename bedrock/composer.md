# Composer

[Composer](http://getcomposer.org) is used to manage dependencies. Bedrock considers any 3rd party library as a dependency including WordPress itself and any plugins.

See these resources for more extensive documentation:

- [Using Composer with WordPress](https://roots.io/using-composer-with-wordpress/)
- [WordPress Plugins with Composer](https://roots.io/wordpress-plugins-with-composer/)
- [Using Composer With WordPress](https://roots.io/screencasts/using-composer-with-wordpress/) (screencast)
- [Private or Commercial WordPress Plugins as Composer Dependencies](https://roots.io/guides/private-or-commercial-wordpress-plugins-as-composer-dependencies/)

## Plugins

[WordPress Packagist](http://wpackagist.org/) is already registered in the `composer.json` file so any plugins from the [WordPress Plugin Directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/) can easily be required.

To add a plugin, add it under the `require` directive or use `composer require <namespace>/<packagename>` from the command line. If it's from WordPress Packagist then the namespace is always `wpackagist-plugin`.

Example: `"wpackagist-plugin/akismet": "dev-trunk"`

Whenever you add a new plugin or update the WP version, run `composer update` to install your new packages.

`plugins`, and `mu-plugins` are Git ignored by default since Composer manages them. If you want to add something to those folders that *isn't* managed by Composer, you need to update `.gitignore` to whitelist them:

`!web/app/plugins/plugin-name`

::: warning Note
Some plugins may create files or folders outside of their given scope, or even make modifications to `wp-config.php` and other files in the `app` directory. These files should be added to your `.gitignore` file as they are managed by the plugins themselves, which are managed via Composer. Any modifications to `wp-config.php` that are needed should be moved into `config/application.php`.
:::

### Force plugin to be mu-plugin

To force a regular `wordpress-plugin` to be treated as a `wordpress-muplugin`, you can update the `installer-paths` config to tell Bedrock to install it in the `mu-plugins` directory:

```yaml
...
  "extra": {
    "installer-paths": {
      "web/app/mu-plugins/{$name}/": ["type:wordpress-muplugin", "advanced-custom-fields/advanced-custom-fields-pro"],
      "web/app/plugins/{$name}/": ["type:wordpress-plugin"],
      "web/app/themes/{$name}/": ["type:wordpress-theme"]
    },
    "wordpress-install-dir": "web/wp"
  },
...
```

**Configuring multiple mu-plugins**

To configure more than one regular `wordpress-plugin` to be treated as a `wordpress-muplugin`, add additional strings to the same array value for the `web/app/mu-plugins/{$name}/` json key, for example:

```yaml
...
      "web/app/mu-plugins/{$name}/": [
        "type:wordpress-muplugin", 
        "advanced-custom-fields/advanced-custom-fields-pro",
        "wpackagist-plugin/gutenberg",
        "wpackagist-plugin/wordpress-seo",
        "wpackagist-plugin/wp-ses"
      ],
...
```


## Updating WP and plugin versions

Updating your WordPress version (or any plugin) is just a matter of changing the version number in the `composer.json` file.

Then running `composer update` will pull down the new version.

### Automating updates

[Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) can be used to automate updates of your Composer dependencies in Bedrock, including WordPress itself.

## Themes

Themes can also be managed by Composer but should only be done so under two conditions:

1. You're using a parent theme that won't be modified at all
2. You want to separate out your main theme and use that as a standalone package

Under most circumstances, we recommend NOT doing #2 and instead keeping your main theme as part of your app's repository.

Just like plugins, WPackagist maintains a Composer mirror of the WP theme directory. To require a theme, just use the `wpackagist-theme` namespace.
