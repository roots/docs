The organization of Bedrock is similar to putting WordPress in its own subdirectory but with some improvements:

- In order not to expose sensitive files in the web root, Bedrock moves what's required into a `web/` directory including the `wp/` source, and the `wp-content` source.
- `wp-content` has been named `app` to better reflect its contents. It contains application code and not just "static content". It also matches up with other frameworks such as Symfony and Rails.
- `wp-config.php` remains in the `web/` because it's required by WP, but it only acts as a loader. The actual configuration files have been moved to `config/` for better separation.
- `vendor/` is where the Composer managed dependencies are installed to.
- `wp/` is where WordPress core lives. It's also managed by Composer but can't be put under `vendor` due to WP limitations.
