# Environment Variables

Bedrock tries to separate config from code as much as possible and environment variables are used to achieve this. The benefit is there's a single place (`.env`) to keep settings like database or other 3rd party credentials that aren't committed to your repository.

[PHP dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) is used to load the `.env` file. All variables are then available in your app by the built-in `getenv`, `$_SERVER`, or `$_ENV` methods.

However, we use the [env](https://github.com/oscarotero/env) library and its `env` function which handles simple type coercion (such as converting the string `'True'` to the boolean `true`). We recommend you use `env` as well for reading environment variables.

Currently, the following env vars are required:
- `WP_HOME`
- `WP_SITEURL`

The following vars are required if `DATABASE_URL` is not set:
- `DB_USER`
- `DB_NAME`
- `DB_PASSWORD`

::: tip Note
There is also the `DATABASE_URL` which is optional.

## WP_ENV

Although it isn't required (if not defined elsewhere, Bedrock will default to `production`), `WP_ENV` is used by several pieces of the Roots stack, as well as software outside of it, to modify behavior based on environment. There are three values you can set for `WP_ENV` that Bedrock will understand:

- `production`
- `staging`
- `development`

Make sure that these are set correctly in your different environments.
