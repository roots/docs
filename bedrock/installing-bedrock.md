## Requirements

* PHP >= 7.1
* Composer ([Installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos))

## Installation

1. Create a new project: 
    ```sh
    $ composer create-project roots/bedrock
    ```
2. Update environment variables in the `.env` file:
  * `DB_NAME` - Database name
  * `DB_USER` - Database user
  * `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password
  * `DB_HOST` - Database host
  * `WP_ENV` - Set to environment (`development`, `staging`, `production`)
  * `WP_HOME` - Full URL to WordPress home (https://example.com)
  * `WP_SITEURL` - Full URL to WordPress including subdirectory (https://example.com/wp)
  * `AUTH_KEY`, `SECURE_AUTH_KEY`, `LOGGED_IN_KEY`, `NONCE_KEY`, `AUTH_SALT`, `SECURE_AUTH_SALT`, `LOGGED_IN_SALT`, `NONCE_SALT`
    * Generate with [wp-cli-dotenv-command](https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/wp-cli-dotenv-command)
    * Generate with [our WordPress salts generator](https://roots.io/salts.html)
3. Add theme(s) in `web/app/themes/` as you would for a normal WordPress site
4. Set the document root on your webserver to Bedrock's `web` folder: `/path/to/site/web/` 
5. Access WordPress admin at `https://example.com/wp/wp-admin/`


### Multisite

Bedrock is multisite network compatible, but needs the [roots/multisite-url-fixer](https://github.com/roots/multisite-url-fixer) mu-plugin on subdomain installs to make sure admin URLs function properly. This plugin is not _needed_ on subdirectory installs but will work well with them. From your Bedrock directory: 

```sh
$ composer require roots/multisite-url-fixer
```
