# Error Handling

[[toc]]

## Introduction

When working in a development environment, Acorn automatically registers an exception handler configured to handle logging as well as the rendering of thrown exceptions. This can be especially useful when diagnosing errors thrown by Blade views.

## Configuration

The `debug` option in your `config/app.php` is solely responsible for whether or not an exception is handled by Acorn. By default, this option is set to respect the value of `wp_get_environment_type() === 'development'`.

During local development, it is highly advised to ensure this variable is set to `true` to properly render exceptions thrown by Blade views and other errors further down the stack.

This should be set to `false` during production.

## The Exception Handler

### Whoops

When an exception gets thrown in the browser, it is passed to [whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops), an error handler framework. If you are familiar with Laravel, you will more than likely recognize the exception page prior to the adaption of Ignition.

### Reporting exceptions

Exception reporting can be used to log exceptions to storage or send them to an external service such as Sentry. By default, exceptions will be logged to disk located in the `storage/logs` folder.

Check out the documentation on [logging](logging.md) to learn more about log implementation.

### Disabling the exception handler

Acorn's `acorn/throw_error_exception` filter can be used to disable the exception handler:

```php
add_filter('acorn/throw_error_exception', '__return_false');
```
