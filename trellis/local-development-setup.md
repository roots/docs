Development is handled by [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) in Trellis. Our `Vagrantfile` automatically uses the Ansible provisioner to run the `dev.yml` playbook and you'll get a virtual machine running your WordPress site.

1. Configure your site(s) based on the [WordPress Sites docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/wordpress-sites/) and read the [development specific](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/wordpress-sites/#development) ones.
2. Make sure you've edited both `group_vars/development/wordpress_sites.yml` and `group_vars/development/vault.yml`.
3. Optionally configure the IP address at the top of the `vagrant.default.yml` and in `hosts/development` to allow for multiple boxes to be run concurrently (default is `192.168.50.5`).
4. Run `vagrant up` (from your trellis directory, usually the `trellis/` subdirectory of your project).

Then let Vagrant and Ansible do their thing. After roughly 5-10 minutes you'll have a server running and a WordPress site automatically installed and configured.

To access the VM, run `vagrant ssh`. Sites can be found at `/srv/www/<site name>`. See the [Vagrant docs](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/) for more commands.

Note that each WP site you configured is synced between your local machine (the host) and the Vagrant VM. Any changes made on your host will be synced to the VM. 

Mounting an encrypted folder is not possible with Trellis due to an issue with NFS. 

Windows users have a slightly different workflow. See the [docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/windows/).
