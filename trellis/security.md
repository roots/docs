# Security

## Locking down root

The `sshd` role heightens your server's security by providing better SSH defaults. SSH password authentication will be disabled. We encourage you to disable SSH `root` login as well. You may adjust these two particular options in `group_vars/all/security.yml`. See the [`sshd` role `README.md`](https://github.com/roots/trellis/tree/master/roles/sshd) for more configuration options.

## Admin user

The first provision via the `server.yml` playbook will create the `admin_user` and set up related [SSH Keys](ssh-keys.md). If you disable `root` login, subsequent connections will be made as the `admin_user`.

## Admin user sudoer password

If `root` login is disabled and the `server.yml` playbook connects as the `admin_user`, it will invoke `sudo` using the password in `vault_users` (`group_vars/<environment>/vault.yml`). If you run the playbook with `--ask-become-pass`, Trellis will use the password you enter via the CLI. You are strongly encouraged to protect the sensitive `vault_users` information by enabling Ansible [Vault](vault.md).
