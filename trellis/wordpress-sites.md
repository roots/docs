Now that you have Trellis' requirements installed and a local project set up, the next thing to do is configure a WordPress site.

Everything in Trellis is built around the concept of "sites". Each Trellis managed server (local virtual machine or remote server) can support one or more WordPress sites. Trellis will automatically configure everything needed to host a WordPress site such as databases, Nginx vhosts, folder directories, etc.

These sites are configured in YAML files for each environment such as `group_vars/development/wordpress_sites.yml`.

There are two components and places to configure sites:

* Normal settings in `group_vars/development/wordpress_sites.yml`
* Passwords/secrets in `group_vars/development/vault.yml`

## Normal settings

`wordpress_sites` is a top-level dictionary used to define all the sites you want. Here's an absolute bare-minimum site as an example for development:

```yaml
# group_vars/development/wordpress_sites.yml
wordpress_sites:
  example.com:
    site_hosts:
      - canonical: example.test
    local_path: ../site # path targeting local Bedrock site directory (relative to Ansible root)
    admin_email: admin@example.test
    multisite:
      enabled: false
    ssl:
      enabled: false
    cache:
      enabled: false
```

Each site starts with a "key" (`example.com` in this case). Trellis uses the key internally as the name of the site and as a default value in a lot of variables. We recommend naming your sites after their domain so it's descriptive.

Nested under the name/key are the site's variables which are for that site only. You only need to define a variable/setting if you want to overwrite the default value which can be found below.

## Passwords/secrets

When you add/edit a site in `wordpress_sites.yml`, you also need to edit `vault.yml` for the accompanying site/key. `vault.yml` simplifies use of the Ansible Vault encryption feature for specific files. You never want to include plain-text passwords in a Git repository so we make it easier to optionally encrypt the `vault.yml` file while leaving the normal settings separate. See [Vault](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/vault/) for more information on this.

```yaml
#  group_vars/development/vault.yml
vault_wordpress_sites:
  example.com:
    admin_password: admin
    env:
      db_password: example_dbpassword
```

Notice the matching site keys in both `wordpress_sites` and `vault_wordpress_sites` for `example.com`.

For a complete working example of a real-life WordPress site, you can view the config files for [roots-example-project.com](https://github.com/roots/roots-example-project.com).

## Options

### Common

* `site_hosts` - List of hosts that Nginx will listen on. At least one is required. Each host item must specify a `canonical` host and may optionally specify a list of corresponding `redirects` (hosts). **Remember to set up DNS for every host listed.** You cannot use just an IP address.

```yaml
# minimum required
example.com:
  site_hosts:
    - canonical: example.com

# multiple hosts and redirects are possible
example.com:
  site_hosts:
    - canonical: example.com
      redirects:
        - www.example.com
        - site.com
    - canonical: example.co.uk
      redirects:
        - www.example.co.uk
```

* `local_path` - path targeting Bedrock-based site directory (*required*)
* `current_path` - symlink to latest release (default: `current`)
* `db_create` - whether to auto create a database or not (default: `true`)
* `packagist_token` - Token to use to authenticate with Packagist.com for private Composer repositories (optional)
* `ssl` - SSL options. See the [SSL docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/ssl/)
* `multisite` - Multisite options. See the [Multisite docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/multisite/)
* `cache` - Nginx FastCGI cache options. See the [Cache docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/fastcgi-caching/)
* `env` - environment variables
  * `disable_wp_cron` - Disable WP cron and use system's (default: `true`)
  * `wp_home` - `WP_HOME` constant (default: `<protocol>://${HTTP_HOST}`)
  * `wp_siteurl` - `WP_SITEURL` constant (default: `${WP_HOME}/wp`)
  * `wp_env` - environment (default: `env` via Ansible)
  * `db_name` - database name (default: `<site name>_<env>`)
  * `db_user` - database username (default: `<site name>`)
  * `db_password` - database password (*required*, in `vault.yml`)
  * `db_host` - database hostname (default: `localhost`)
  * `db_user_host` - hostname or ip range used to restrict connections to database (default: `localhost`)

* `repo_subtree_path` - relative path to your Bedrock/WP directory in your repo (above) if its not the root (like site/ in roots-example-project)
* `branch` - the branch name, tag name, or commit SHA1 you want to deploy (default: `master`)
* `env` - environment variables
  * `auth_key` - Generate (*required* in `vault.yml`)
