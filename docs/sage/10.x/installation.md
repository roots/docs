# Installation

## What is Sage?

Sage is a [WordPress starter theme](https://roots.io/sage/).

### Why use Sage?

- Harness the power of [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and its available packages thanks to [Acorn](https://github.com/roots/acorn).
- Clean, efficient theme templating utilizing [Laravel Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/master/blade).
- Lightning fast frontend development workflow powered by [Bud](https://bud.js.org/).
- Out of the box support for [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Getting Started

Sage relies on Node.js based tools to manage dependencies and build assets. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install and manage Node.js. We also recommend using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

```bash
# Install the latest LTS version of Node.js
$ nvm install --lts

# Globally install Yarn
$ npm install --global yarn
```

## Acorn

Sage requires Acorn but doesn't ship with it included. This is to give you the flexibility to include it in a way that works best for your environment.

## Installing Sage with Composer

Install Sage using Composer from your WordPress themes directory (replace `your-theme-name` below with the name of your theme):

```sh
# From your WordPress themes directory, run:
$ composer create-project roots/sage your-theme-name
```

To install the latest development version of Sage, add `dev-main` to the end of the command:

$ composer create-project roots/sage your-theme-name dev-main
```
