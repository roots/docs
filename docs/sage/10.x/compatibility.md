# Compatibility

## Adding support for plugins

- No current official support for WooCommerce, but there are a number of options from the community that may be helpful:
    - [https://github.com/ptrckvzn/sage-woocommerce](https://github.com/ptrckvzn/sage-woocommerce)
    - [https://github.com/generoi/sage-woocommerce](https://github.com/ptrckvzn/sage-woocommerce)
    

## Known issues with plugins

- [Disqus Comment System](https://github.com/roots/sage/issues/2035#issuecomment-369673419) is not compatible with Sage.
    There is a [Laravel-based solution](https://github.com/yajra/laravel-disqus) which may work (untested).
