description: Before installing Trellis the requirements must be met. After installing Ansible, Virtualbox, and Vagrant, setup your Trellis directory structure.

# Installation

Trellis relies on a few other software tools. Make sure all dependencies have been installed before moving on:

- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx)
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) >= 4.3.10
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) >= 2.1.0

::: tip Windows user?
[Read the Windows getting started docs](../../getting-started/windows.md) for slightly different installation instructions.
:::

This is the minimum requirements for a development server. Vagrant automatically takes care of the Ansible dependency for us by default.

To speed up future dev VM provisioning, or for remote servers, you'll need to install Ansible locally on your host machine.

See [Requirements](remote-server-setup.md#requirements) under Remote Server Setup.

## Create a project

The recommended directory structure for a Trellis project looks like:

```bash
example.com/      # → Root folder for the project
├── trellis/      # → Your clone of this repository
└── site/         # → A Bedrock-based WordPress site
    └── web/
        ├── app/  # → WordPress content directory (themes, plugins, etc.)
        └── wp/   # → WordPress core (don't touch!)
```

See a complete working example in the [roots-example-project.com repo](https://github.com/roots/roots-example-project.com).

Pick a descriptive name for your project and use it instead of the default `example.com`. We recommend the domain of the site for convenience.

1. Create a new project directory:
```bash
$ mkdir example.com && cd example.com
```
2. Install Trellis:
```bash
$ git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:roots/trellis.git && rm -rf trellis/.git
```
3. Install Bedrock into the `site` directory:
```bash
$ composer create-project roots/bedrock site
```
