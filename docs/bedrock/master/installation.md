# Installation

[[toc]]

## Requirements

- PHP >= 7.1
- Composer ([Installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos))

## Getting Started

1. Create a new project:
    ```bash
    $ composer create-project roots/bedrock
    ```
2. Update environment variables in the `.env` file:
  - Database variables
    - `DB_NAME` - Database name
    - `DB_USER` - Database user
    - `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password
    - `DB_HOST` - Database host
    - Optionally, you can define `DATABASE_URL` for using a DSN instead of using the variables above (e.g. `mysql://user:password@127.0.0.1:3306/db_name`)
  - `WP_ENV` - Set to environment (`development`, `staging`, `production`)
  - `WP_HOME` - Full URL to WordPress home (https://example.com)
  - `WP_SITEURL` - Full URL to WordPress including subdirectory (https://example.com/wp)
  - `AUTH_KEY`, `SECURE_AUTH_KEY`, `LOGGED_IN_KEY`, `NONCE_KEY`, `AUTH_SALT`, `SECURE_AUTH_SALT`, `LOGGED_IN_SALT`, `NONCE_SALT`
    - Generate with [wp-cli-dotenv-command](https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/wp-cli-dotenv-command)
    - Generate with [our WordPress salts generator](https://roots.io/salts.html)
3. Add theme(s) in `web/app/themes/` as you would for a normal WordPress site
4. Set the document root on your webserver to Bedrock's `web` folder: `/path/to/site/web/`
5. Access WordPress admin at `https://example.com/wp/wp-admin/`

### Multisite

Bedrock is multisite network compatible, but needs the [roots/multisite-url-fixer](https://github.com/roots/multisite-url-fixer) mu-plugin on subdomain installs to make sure admin URLs function properly. This plugin is not _needed_ on subdirectory installs but will work well with them. From your Bedrock directory:

```bash
$ composer require roots/multisite-url-fixer
```
